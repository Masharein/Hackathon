JS quiz website.
There are a few things I really like about this game.
First of all the styling! Looks like you guys really know your css. I love the rocket in the background, the stars, the planet...
You displayed your knowlege of the studied material: Dom manipulation, advanced array methods, conditionals.
Your functions are practical and do what they need to do, I like the usage of localstorage to set the most recent score and highscore; and 
also initiating an empty array in localstorage if it does not already exist.
Great project, good job guys!
